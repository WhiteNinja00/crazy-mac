On my YouTube channel, (ActuallyMaddix), I would post cover's of FNF songs before I really got into the modding scene. And one of the covers was Tod vs Me over Expurgation from the Tricky mod. That's about it, I just wanted to bring something old back and show how far people can come with their abilities to do certain things after years.
