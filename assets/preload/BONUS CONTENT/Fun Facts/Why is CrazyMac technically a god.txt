This mod started production about 2 years ago, but fell flat since nobody knew how to make mods almost. The idea resurfaced recently, and since everyone has learned more and better technology came out, FNF modding was easier and CrazyMac started production. In the prototype 2 years ago, CrazyMac was originally a god, just like a majority of the old FNF mods. Happy > Angry > God form. So we just stuck with the idea.
