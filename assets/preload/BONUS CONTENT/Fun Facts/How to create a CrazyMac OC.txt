Step 1. Grayscale your OC.

Step 2. Remove you OC's mouth and give your OC lifeless eyes.

Step 3. Hide your little Mackling somewhere clever on your OC. If you can't think of anywhere clever, just give your character a little button with the Mackling on it.

Step 4. Give your CrazyMac OC a name by starting the name with "Crazy" and follow it with a random noun. (EX. CrazyPin, CrazyBall, CrazyCan)

Step 5. YOU'RE DONE! If you happen to actually follow this tutorial and make a CrazyMac OC, tag me on Twitter @ActuallyMaddix or use the tags #CrazyMac or #CrazyMacOC !
