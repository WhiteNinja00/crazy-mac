I really hope so. My policy for this to get a V2 is if this were to get popular. I don't want to continue a project that will only get seen by a few people. This is a project I have been very passionate about for the past months and I really want it to get some recognition. So I suppose if this were to get some-what big, then yes, there will be a V2 of CrazyMac. New songs and new paths depending on which ending you got in V1
