There is a seperate world of beings called 'Macklings' and their only want in the world is the ability to sing. They can kind of sing, but their voices are garbled and junky until they get their hands on a victim via a Discord Nitro scam. The mackling that hacked Tod chose the name 'CrazyMac'. The mackling's only goal is to get other people hacked.
