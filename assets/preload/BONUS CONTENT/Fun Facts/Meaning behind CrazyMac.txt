CrazyMac was originally created by Tod as a joke to troll and mess with his brother. There were no malicious intents originally with CrazyMac, until I wanted there to be a mod about him. I gave him backstory and a whole new coat of paint, giving him a design and what-not. CrazyMac is still technically not my character, he is Tod's character.
